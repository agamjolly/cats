# CATS --- The Typing Game
A project game inspired by Typeracer that allows users to compete in typing competitions, with a built-in autocorrect system. The game allows you to compete in typing races in multiplayer and offline modes. Web interface made using Flask, React and SQLAlchemy, developed by CS61A course staff. Backend written in Python.

# Running the game

` git clone https://www.github.com/ `

```
